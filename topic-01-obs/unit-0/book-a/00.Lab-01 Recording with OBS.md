How to record, upload and share a presentation on a Windows 10 PC

We assume you are working with a set of PowerPoint slides, and that you do not initially wish to use a camera. It will also cover uploading and sharing the video via YouTube.

We will use the following applications:

- PowerPoint for slides - the locally installed version
- [Open Broadcast Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for recording
- [Youtube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/) for sharing

In addition, we will use this utility:

- [Sizer 4](http://www.brianapps.net/sizer4/) : A convenience utility for resizing windows

The steps here will guide you though the installation of all of the above + recording and uploading a slide based lecture.
